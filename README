Dependencies:
junit-4.12.jar - for unit tests
hamcrest-core-1.3.jar - for junit


Run Instructions:
To run the program after building the project, first ensure that the RMI
registry is running in the same directory as the .class files.

`CS414GroupF/out/production/CS414GroupF/$ rmiregistry`

Then, start the Server on a machine, specifying the host IP (localhost or
127.0.0.* required for the server) and the port number:

`CS414GroupF/out/production/CS414GroupF/$ java server.Server <host> <port>`

Then, start any number of clients with the Server's IP and port number:

`CS414GroupF/out/production/CS414GroupF/$ java views.Main <host> <port>`

To log onto any view but the customer, you will need the appropriate login
credentials. The Manager credentials will work for all three views:

Manager: 321
Chef: 123
Cashier: 000


What's good:
The project's business logic, views, and controllers are separated well. The
project is cleanly distributed and works well across multiple machines with RMI.

What's missing:
The customer loyalty system only has a manager-facing component and is not
functional with customer accounts.

Patterns used:
RMI was used to distribute the system. The MVC pattern was used to refactor the
existing system and desgin the new one.
